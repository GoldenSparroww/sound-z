## About
This application was created as a project with a single goal – to learn JavaScript and the basics of React. It is supposed to be a simple music player inspired by Spotify, Soundcloud, and one very specific player from my old Nokia phone from 2010 :D.
## If you are interested…
In case you wonder how this application looks like, you have to do small setup first.
1. Download this package and run `npm install` (assuming you already got node.js)
2. Setup apache server for short PHP backend, where music is going to be placed. If given exact steps...
    1. Download and install XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/)
    2. In XAMPP menu start 'Apache' and open 'explorer'
    4. **And then contact me for backend scripts with data to place into `htdocs` directory, because i cannot provide these files (due to copyright) publicly there. It was project only for me after all…**
    5. Then if you ran the frontend with npm and backend with apache it should all work
