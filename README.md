## About
This application was created as a project with a single goal – make something of JavaScript and React. It is supposed to be a simple music player inspired by Spotify, Soundcloud, and one very specific player from my old Nokia phone from 2010 :D.

All available music and images are free to use from https://www.pixabay.com.
## If you are interested…
In case you wonder how this application looks like, you have to do small setup first.
1. Download this package and run `npm install` (assuming you already got node.js)
2. Setup apache server for short PHP backend, where music is going to be placed. If given exact steps...
    1. Download and install XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/)
    2. In XAMPP menu start 'Apache' and open 'explorer'
    4. Extract the content of 'backend.zip' archive into 'htdocs' directory
    5. Then if you ran the frontend with npm and backend with apache it should all work
